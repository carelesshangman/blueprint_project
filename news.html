            <p class="newstext"><a class="blueprint">Blueprint</a> is a smart assistant developed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carelesshangman/">Jaka German</a>.
                The idea behind the machine was inspired by multiple robot-like characters in movies and videogames,
                 for example HAL 9000 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> or
                  GLaDOS from <a href="https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">Valve's Portal</a> series. Main difference between these fictional characters 
                  and <a class="blueprint">Blueprint</a> is the evil nature of the characters. While GLaDOS and HAL had no intention in helping their hosts, <a class="blueprint">Blueprint</a>
                  provides useful functions, like music, internet browsing and even helps out with programming and electronics if you ask it to.

                "When you understand how to make a robot companion, the code writes itself" -  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carelesshangman/">Jaka German</a><br>
                By observing similar projects I was able to learn so much. My main takeaway from Project <a class="blueprint">Blueprint</a> was that learning new
                programming skills really isn't difficult. In a matter of months I went from an average JavaScript user to a quite adept one.
